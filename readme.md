#### WHAT IS IT?
All this is a simple note of the normal techniques for running javascript. A list of useful ready-to-use templates that anyone can use to learn or reconstruct what is needed in their small or large projects. It's a 360° free resource.
<br>

#### HOW CAN YOU HELP?
Simple... If you think you have an excellent standardizable pattern, propose it to the staff to be added (you or the pattern) to this repository.

If you want, <b>you can always support us with a donation</b> (it's important for we, thank you!), just click on the banner of a repository ;)
<br>

#### WHO DID THAT?
This is an open project built by Alberto Marangelo (@berto-dev) [¹](https://berto.dev) [²](https://github.com/berto-dev) <br>
<sup>If you use in your blog it's a good idea to include <i>"taken from original GITPAGE of the AUTHORSLINK"</i></sup>
<br>

#### UPDATE TIMES?
It is a rolling release, which therefore means that there is no update time for this repository. Things are fixed as they are noticed and new things are implemented as they become available.
<br>

#### LICENCE ROLES?
The user license is the MIT. As far as we are concerned, you can do "almost" as you think best as long as you respect those who undertake to give you this material. Enjoy ^_^ !
